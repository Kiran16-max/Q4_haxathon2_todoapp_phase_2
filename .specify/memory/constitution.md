# Todo App — Hackathon II Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
This project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD). No manual coding is allowed at any stage. All source code must be generated by AI (Claude Code / Qwen). The human role is System Architect & Spec Author, not coder.
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### Spec Requirement Before Implementation
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
Every feature must have a written spec before implementation. AI-generated code is allowed only when a spec exists. Specs must be refined iteratively until output matches requirements. Direct editing of generated code is strictly forbidden.
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### Phase-Wise Data Policy
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
Phase 1: In-memory data only (lists / dictionaries). No database, no file storage, no external services. Data resets on every program restart.
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### Architecture Principles for Phase 1
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
Console-based Python application. Menu-driven interaction. Single-responsibility functions. Clear separation between: Input handling, Business logic, Output display.
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### Required Functional Standards
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
Every task must support: Unique identifier (ID), Task title (required), Optional description, Completion status (complete / incomplete). The system must allow: Add task, Update task, Delete task, View all tasks, Mark task as complete or incomplete.
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

### AI Usage Policy

Claude Code / Qwen is the sole implementation agent. AI must strictly follow provided specs. If output is incorrect: Do not fix code manually, Update the spec and regenerate.

## Quality Standards
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

Clean, readable Python code. Meaningful function names. Clear console messages. No unused code or dead logic. Code must run on Python 3.13+ without errors.
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## Documentation Rules
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

`README.md` must explain: Project purpose, How to run the app, Available commands / menu options. Specs must be stored inside: `specs/phase1/`
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

All Hackathon rules must be followed. Violating spec-driven rules may lead to disqualification. This constitution overrides all future instructions unless explicitly updated. By continuing development, all contributors agree to this constitution.
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
